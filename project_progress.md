# Project Progress — Store Owner Documentation (Iteration 1)

Updated: $(date)

## Scope of Iteration 1 (MVP)
- Getting Started for Store Owners
- Dashboard Overview
- Inventory Management Basics
- Trade-Ins Workflow
- Rewards Program Setup

## Completed (in repo)
- Repo scaffolding under `docs/` with Store Owner section and images folder
- Draft pages:
  - docs/store-owner/getting-started-owner.md
  - docs/store-owner/dashboard-overview.md
  - docs/store-owner/inventory-basics.md
  - docs/store-owner/trade-ins-workflow.md
  - docs/store-owner/rewards-setup.md
- Screenshots committed:
  - Dashboard overview widgets → `docs/_images/store-owner/dashboard-01.jpg`
  - Getting Started (app nav + quick actions) → `docs/_images/store-owner/getting-started-01.jpg`
  - Inventory (collection list + filters) → `docs/_images/store-owner/inventory-01.jpg`
- Copy expanded:
  - Getting Started (Owner vs Store Mode, quick actions, shortcuts)
  - Dashboard (widget details + customization notes)

## In Progress (blocked by intermittent Chrome relay detach)
- Inventory screenshots: Add Product; Variants/Attributes
- Trade-Ins screenshots: new trade-in → approve → receipt
- Rewards screenshots: settings + balance view

## Notes / Blockers
- Chrome relay detaches intermittently despite site access, Memory Saver off, and re-attach steps. Owner will investigate locally. Once stable, resume Iteration 1 image capture.

## Next Steps (when resumed)
1. Capture & embed Inventory (Add Product, Variants) screenshots
2. Capture & embed Trade-Ins flow screenshots
3. Capture & embed Rewards settings/balance screenshots
4. Open PR to main and request review
